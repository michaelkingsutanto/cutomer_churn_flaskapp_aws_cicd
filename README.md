# Customer Churn Prediction
> Author: Michael King Sutanto

### Project Overview
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn using various customer-related features. The Flask app provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input customer data and receive predictions on whether a customer is likely to churn.  

This project encompasses a wide range of skills and technologies, including SQL queries, data visualization, building classification machine learning models, creating a Flask app with Python, HTML, and CSS, utilizing Docker, and deploying the application on AWS. Additionally, I set up an API to provide programmatic access to the model. I also built a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.

### Model
The final model chosen for deployment was the CatBoostClassifier due to its superior performance in terms of ROC-AUC score.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: 0.9148
